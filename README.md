LFP recording
Description
Two examples of using LFP recording in NetPyNE:

LFP recording for a single cell -- M1 corticospinal neuron -- with 700+ compartments (segments) and multiple somatic and dendritic ionic channels. The cell parameters are loaded from a .json file. The cell receives NetStim input to its soma via an excitatory synapse. Ten LFP electrodes are placed at both sides of the neuron at 5 different cortical depths. The soma voltage, LFP time-resolved signal and the 3D locations of the electrodes are plotted
